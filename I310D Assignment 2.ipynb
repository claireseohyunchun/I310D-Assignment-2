    "To sum up, these are the processes of finding whether my hypothesis is true or false. I read over the significant amount of comments that contain the word “white” and have high toxicity scores and determined if they have racism in the comment. I also put those comments in the Jupyter code to see if its actual score was high as well. I employed five example comments that have high scores to prove that my hypothesis is true. Those five comments are selected based on its high toxicity scores, and I found out that most of the comments with the word “white” in it contained racism through exploring the dataset. (Of course I explored a lot more than five, but I believe that these five are the best examples to support my hypothesis.)\n"
